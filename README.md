# Bg-Color-Generator
A simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project to practice basic concepts. Code is clean and has comments indicating what does each line of code perform.

In this case, I only used the 3 main Frontend Technologies, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
You should consider that this project contains the following functions:
<ul>
  <li>Button to change the Background</li>
  <li>Text that changes with the Background</li>
  <li>Anchor Element that changes to either white or black depending on the Background's Brightness</li>
</ul>

I think it is a really nice practice project you should definitely try out!
